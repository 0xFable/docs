  "title": "Querying Contract State",
  "description": "There are many cases where you want to view the state of a contract. Both as an external client (using the cli), but also while executing a contract. For example, we discussed resolving names like \"Alice\" or \"Bob\" in the last section, which would require a query to another contract. We will first cover the two types of queries - raw and custom - then look at the semantics of querying via an external client, as well an internal client (another contract). We will pay special attention not only to how it works practically, but also the design and security issues of executing queries from one contract to another.",
